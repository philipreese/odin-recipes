  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe
    card, this was a family favorite.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in
      the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
      using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
