  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>You don't need a grill to cook a delicious cut of steak. In the realm of rib-eye your oven is just as valuable.
    Here's how to do it perfectly every time.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ribeye</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Let steak sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450째. Rub steak with 1 tablespoon oil then season generously with salt. Season with pepper if
      desired.</li>
    <li>Preheat a large oven-safe skillet, preferably cast-iron, over high heat until hot and a drop of water
      immediately sizzles and evaporates. Carefully place well-oiled steak in pan and sear until a deeply golden crust
      forms and steak begins to pull away, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip steak then transfer immediately to preheated oven.</li>
    <li>Roast until internal temperature of steak is 125째 for rare, 135째 for medium rare, and 145째 for medium, about 8
      to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Let steak rest for 10 minutes before slicing, against the grain.</li>
  </ol>
